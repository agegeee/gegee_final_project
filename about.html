                <h1>The Writer, Cook, Photographer and Occasional Dishwasher</h1>
                <p>Deb Perelman is the kind of person you might innocently ask what the difference is between summer and winter squash and she’ll go on for about twenty minutes before coming up for air to a cleared room and you soundly snoring. It’s taken some time, but she’s finally realized that there are people out there that might forgive her for such food, cooking and ingredient-obsessed blathering and possibly, even come back for more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In previous iterations of her so-called career, she’s been a record store shift supervisor, a scrawler of “happy birthday” on bakery cakes, an art therapist and a technology reporter. She likes her current gig – the one where she wakes up and cooks whatever she feels like that day – the best. When she’s not prattling on about galley and grub here, Deb is an occasional freelance writer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Deb likes bourbon, artichokes, french fries, things that taste like burnt sugar and baked goods with funny names. She lives in the East Village with her husband Alex (likes: salt, shellfish, things wrapped, stuffed or balanced on bacon, steak frites, milk chocolate, Bloody Marys, pretty much anything pickled, and Deb, although she is usually not), son Jacob (likes: chocolate, bananas, spaghetti, pizza, cheeseburgers) and daughter Anna (likes: blueberries, strawberries, peaches, apples, edamame, sweet potatoes, and Cheerios).</p>

                  <p class="times-new-roman-text">The Smitten Kitchen is a 16 year-old food blog celebrating triumphant but unfussy cooking. It. wants to be the place you go to find your new favorite thing to cook. Physically, the Smitten Kitchen is a kind of half-galley with a wobbly, peeling cart used as a cooking surface. What it lacks in cabinets, a dishwasher that doesn’t leak and refrigerator that doesn’t freeze everything in the back, it makes up for in streams of light from the door on the side that goes to [drumroll] a terrace, where I attempt — with varying degrees of success failure — to grow tomatoes, herbs and whatever other mystery seeds my kids find at the playground and stick in the soil.

                    [SK I: pre-2009 was a whopping 80 square feet with a skylight on top. SK II: 2009 to 2014 was dark-speckled and tiny but we were too excited to finally have a dishwasher, elevator and almost enough room for a tiny human to notice.]

                    What you’ll see here is a lot of comfort foods stepped up a bit, things like bread and birthday cakes made entirely from scratch and tutorials on everything from how to poach an egg to how to make tart doughs that don’t shrink up on you, but also a favorite side dish (zucchini and almonds) that takes fewer than five minutes to make.
                    
                    What I’m wary of is: Excessively fussy foods and/or pretentious ingredients. I don’t do truffle oil, Himalayan pink salt at $10 per quarter-ounce or single-origin chocolate that can only be found through Posh Nosh-approved purveyors. I think food should be accessible, and am certain that you don’t need any of these things to cook fantastically.
